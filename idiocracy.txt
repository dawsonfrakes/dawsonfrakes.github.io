I can't do anything. I am stuck. Why? When I finally come upon something I want to do, my brain finds eight million reasons I shouldn't.

Scenario: I want to make a game.
1. Pick an OS to develop on/for. I usually decide on Windows because if I want my friends to play with me (I do) then there will need to at least be a Windows port.
2. Pick a language. It will always be C, probably.
3. Either C annoys me into wanting to make a new language, or Windows annoys me into making a new OS.
4a. Languages are annoying to design correctly.
4b. OSs are annoying because hardware is uglier than Windows's APIs (somehow).

Conclusion: I am a software elitist and perfectionist, and this is a hindrance.
