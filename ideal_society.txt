You are free to do anything that doesn't infringe on someone else's liberties.
There are to be no primary leaders or idols.
There is to be no money. Earth is plenty abundant for all to live personally satisfying lives.
You are to be a good steward and caretaker of our world.
You are not to have more than two children. Replacement value for yourselves. If you want more, trade child-slots with someone else. But be damn sure they're okay with that, because if they get pregnant without a remaining child-slot: abortion.
The people are the judges. If someone does something wrong, it's up to their surrounding group how punishment is dealt. It's up to the next surrounding group to determine if the first was justifiable in their punishment. etc. etc. (Think rings of justifiability. This propogation will in theory keep everyone in check, as those in the center do not wish to infringe on anyone else's liberties, and neither do those who judge them.)
There is no property. Private or personal. Everyone gets their own fair share of everything (equivalence defined by needs for individual survival and thrivation).
Earth (and wherever else we find ourselves) is for all. Any religion, race, gender, (insert other thing currently dividing Americans) is accepted, as long as it doesn't infringe on the freedom of someone else.
All humans are equal. Cultures can and will vary.
Understanding of other cultures is not necessary, as long as they're not conflicting with anyone's liberties, they are free to remain as they are.
When attempting to traverse new land, the current occupants may not be aware it's now owned by all. Allow them fair opportunity to convert to the new ideals, and be forgiving/compassionate if they are defensive at first. (Or be willing to justify to your neighbors(aka nearby humans) why you stayed their occupation.)
Be kind to all creatures. Only harm if necessary for (JUSTFIABLE!) safety or healthy survival(nutrition).
