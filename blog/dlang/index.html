  <h1>Handmade-style Programming in D</h1>
  <p>THIS POST IS A WORK IN PROGRESS (as of 11/04/2024).</p>
  <p>I considered myself a C programmer. It was the only language I've tried that allowed me to express myself fully.
    Either by using some ugly macros or writing a separate program that read my program's text and generated
    information I could then use in my program. These are hacks but they work for simple language like C.
    As far as the languages I tried: C++ and Rust were too complicated to ever implement a compiler for if I wanted/needed to for
    some obscure architecture; Nim and V didn't let me flip enough switches to generate C code as well as I could by hand;
    Odin and C3 are too C-like without adding major benefits to make the switch worth it for me; Zig doesn't make metaprogramming
    (outside of the excellent type system) very easy; Jai isn't publicly released yet and still requires a linker (ew!).
  </p>
  <p>With that said, what does my ideal language look like? It would be designed by <a href="https://guide.handmadehero.org/">Casey Muratori</a>, of course.
    Or, basically Jai's end goal: powerful metaprogramming, fast compilation,
    no linker, no custom macro language, first-class types, publicly available compilers, etc. Enter its (only) true competitor: D.</p>
  <h2>Expressivity</h2>
  <p>While D can be as expressive as Python with its UFCS, Slices,
    Dynamic Arrays, Associative Arrays, Lambdas, Delegates, Object Orientedness,
    Concurrency, Garbage Collection, etc... <em>minimalism</em> is more on track with what I want.
    We can often do better than what the standard library implements (although D's Standard Library <em>Phobos</em> is quite good) because we know our specific use cases.
    Not to mention you <em>must</em> implement your own code if you want it to work with <code>-betterC</code>.
    (Note this is subject to change as D contributors are attempting to make Phobos run without the GC as much as possible.)</p>
  <h3>Uniform Function Call Syntax (UFCS)</h3>
  <p>Fancy name. What does it mean?</p>
  <pre><code class="d">"dmd -betterC -run main".split.spawnProcess.wait;</code></pre>
  <p>is equivalent to</p>
  <pre><code class="d">wait(spawnProcess(split("dmd -betterC -run main")));</code></pre>
  <p>Ah! Just some nice syntactic sugar which shows the flow of execution more clearly.
    Powerful, so not to be overused of course, but nice in certain contexts. Works with arguments too:</p>
  <pre><code class="d">myNumber.abs.min(10.0).max(5.0)</code></pre>
  <h3>Template Parameters</h3>
  <p>Single arguments can be passed without parentheses. &Aacute;tila Neves said prefer const over auto where possible, so there you go. Immutable would be even better here since we aren't processing dynamic data.</p>
  <pre><code class="d">const x = [5, 10, 15].sort!max;</code></pre>
  <h3>Lambdas</h3>
  <pre><code class="d">const myLambda = int function() { return 5; };
const myLambda = function() { return 5; };
const myLambda = () { return 5; };
const myLambda = { return 5; }
const myLambda = () => 5;</code></pre>
  <p>Lambdas can also be passed as template parameters.</p>
  <pre><code class="d">filter!(x => x &lt; 2)</code></pre>
  <h3>Lowering and scope(exit)</h3>
  <h3>with statement</h3>
  <h3>UDAs</h3>
  <p><a href="https://forum.dlang.org/post/mailman.9750.1560971275.29801.digitalmars-d-learn@puremagic.com">Can't escape keywords</a>, where Zig has @"" syntax.</p>
  <h2>BetterC</h2>
  <p>Finally a language worthy of the name C + 1.</p>
  <p>Operator overloading (that doesn't suck?)</p>
  <p>proper null value and noreturn type</p>
  <p>ptr->mem to ptr.mem</p>
  <p>int x[5] to int[5] x</p>
  <p>const(T) and immutable</p>
  <pre><code class="d">struct Slice(T) { T* ptr; size_t length; }</code></pre>
  <pre><code class="d">struct BoundedArray(T, size_t N) {
    T[N] buffer;
    size_t length;

    T* ptr() => buffer.ptr;
}</code></pre>
  <h2>Metaprogramming</h2>
  <a href="https://wiki.dlang.org/Compile-time_vs._compile-time">Comptime is a misnomer.</a>
  <h3>static assert and static if</h3>
  <h3>version and debug</h3>
  <h3>Enum Manifest Constants</h3>
  <p>What do you think when you see this?</p>
  <pre><code class="d">enum x = [5, 10, 15];</code></pre>
  <p>My first response as a C programmer was: "What. How is an enum assigned to something, and why isn't that something an integer?"
    Let's start simpler.</p>
  <pre><code class="d">// Whew. That's more like it. Valid C (minus a semicolon) && D!
enum MyEnum { A, B, C }
// the same as
enum MyEnum { A = 0, B = 1, C = 2 }</code></pre>
  <p>But D gives us some syntactic sugar for when an enum only has one member.</p>
  <pre><code class="d">enum C = 2;</code></pre>
  <p>Enums are compile-time only values. Their contents are not stored in our executable. Interestingly, D let's us store any value
    in an enum, not just integers!</p>
  <pre><code class="d">enum MyEnum { A = "A", B = 25, C = true }
// or forcibly typed...
enum MyEnum : string { A = "A", B = "HELLO", C = "world" }
// or...
enum string B = "HELLO";
// or inferred...
enum B = "HELLO";</code></pre>
  <p>Because enum's are compile-time only, we can have an arbitrarily complex expression result in a compiler only variable.
    The following lambda gets called and its result is stored in the constant.</p>
  <pre><code class="d">enum resultantString = { string x; x ~= "Hello, world!\n"; return x; }();</code></pre>
  <p>Note for arrays you should use immutable instead of enum manifest constants as enum's are reinitialized on each use.
    Of course only do this if you need the array in your final executable.</p>
  <h3>Typed Varargs</h3>
  <h3>Hygenic Macros (Goodbye X Macros)</h3>
  <pre><code class="d">alias AliasSeq!(T...) = T;</code></pre>
<pre><code class="d">template Procedure(RT, string name_, Args...) {
    alias ReturnType = RT;
    enum name = name_;
    alias ArgTypes = Args;
}</code></pre>
  <h3>Mixins and -mixin=file</h3>

  <h2>Windows</h2>
  <h3>extern(Windows), pragma(linkerDirective, ...), pragma(lib, ...) </h3>
  <h3>Debugging</h3>
  <p><code>dmd</code> and <code>ldc</code> output PDBs that can be read by RemedyBG/WinDBG!</p>
