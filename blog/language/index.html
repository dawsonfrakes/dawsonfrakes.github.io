  <h1>Language.</h1>
  <h2>May 10, 2025</h2>
  <p>
    I have a problem. Every time I sit down to start a project it goes well... until it doesn't.
    It usually takes about one night of sleep, or 500 lines, whichever comes first, to realize I won't be able to continue my project.
    It has either become too much for me to hold in my head or there's some pitfall in my language of choice that seems insurmountable.
    Now the first problem can likely only be solved by therapy (e.g. writing this article) to get over my fears, but that still leaves us problem number two.
  </p>
  <p>
    "If you want something done right you often have to do it yourself." I knew this, but ignored it for as long as could. Now the time has come,
    because I recognized the pattern: I will never be emotionally satisfied enough to finish a project in a language I don't respect. These languages
    I'm bashing aren't fundamentally wrong most of the time; they just don't jive with what I want from a language. But that doesn't mean I won't
    take their good qualities and mash them all together into a frankenstein's monster of beauty(?).
  </p>
  <p>
    The list of languages that I'll use as inspiration for this language is quite large. Here we go.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>C/C++: Well, C anyway. C++ will serve as inspiration of what not to do.</li>
    <li>D: A language which isn't afraid of providing a solution to a problem. Every problem. Every solution. If you were skinning a cat, there'd be a dozen ways to do it in D.</li>
    <li>Jai: Jon's ideas are great. However execution is on par with what you expect from a perfectionist. Slow and steady meandering to an epic final solution. It's just not there yet.</li>
    <li>Odin: A beautifully simple language. Completely opposite philosophy of Jai; do almost nothing at compile-time and write generators when/if you need them. An elegant C replacement.</li>
    <li>Zig: The best type system I have used.</li>
    <li>fasm: Yes, the flat assembler. My language will be an interpreted-at-compile-time yet systems programming language, in a very similar vein to fasm.</li>
    <li>Lisp/Scheme: Code is just data structures to be operated on.</li>
    <li>Python: Off-side rule, baby. Just need to ditch the awkward sigils used everywhere.</li>
    <li>Cakelisp: To prove that a one-person built programming language is worth making.</li>
    <li>Janet: A language I'd never used until after I started the design for my language. Quite similar in spirit.</li>
    <li>Wisp: Lisp, minus the parentheses. As it says on the tin. Neat syntax choices.</li>
    <li>Wart: Lisp, minus the parentheses, plus indentation.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Okay, so what does that inspiration make? Well here's my favorite syntax so far.
  </p>
  <pre><code>$using ($import "syntax/odin-d-amalgamation")

enum Code_Kind
  IDENTIFIER
  KEYWORD
  INTEGER
  FLOAT
  STRING
  TUPLE

union Code_Data
  : as_atom string
  : as_tuple [dynamic]^Code

struct Code
  : kind Code_Kind
  : data Code_Data
  using data

struct Parse_Result
  : code ^Code
  : next-pos uint

proc parse_code () Parse_Result
  ; important stuff goes here
  return (Parse_Result #code nil #next-pos p)</code></pre>
  <p>
    That's quite literally the AST structure of the compiler. It's meant to be as simple to parse as Lisp, with a bit of added complexity
    in the implicitness of parentheses on each newline, and indentation being the method of grouping multiple expressions without parentheses.
    You may have noticed the $ in front of $using and $import; these are builtins. Builtins are the only thing the interpreter provides.
    The default environment is empty. I'm trying to keep the number of builtins below 20... we'll see how that goes. There are no reserved keywords.
  </p>
  <p>
    Anyway, all forms must expand down to the builtins for any work to be done. The interpreter has no knowledge of compilation.
    Compilation is simply performed by importing a module that's full of procedures and macros which boil down to builtins. These macros take
    the code, perform their manipulation of it, and output whatever you requested from them. If I want a regular program like I'd have in C it would look like this:
  </p>
  <pre><code>$define void ($type 'VOID)
$define c-char ($type 'INTEGER '(#bits 8 #signed true))
$define c-int ($type 'INTEGER '(#bits 32 #signed true))
$define char* ($type 'POINTER '(#kind 'MULTIPLE #child c-char))
$define 'printf
  $extern 'printf #library "msvcrt"
    $type 'PROCEDURE '(#parameters (char*) #return c-int #callconv 'C #flags 'VARARGS)

$proc 'main '() void #callconv 'C
  printf "The answer to the ultimate question is %d.\n" 42

$using ($import "compilation")
create-pe64-executable "My Cool Project" #entry main #subsystem 'WINDOWS #target 'AMD64</code></pre>
<p>
  The "create executable" macro can just convert all $extern builtins to static/dynamic libraries' procedure calls, etc. As you can see,
  using builtins is quite ugly compared to the custom syntaxes you can make to wrap them. Of course it's easy to go overboard, but like Cakelisp,
  we put the trust in the programmer and give them the tools to shoot off their feet. There could be fewer builtins, such as removing $using since it's
  only about three lines to implement it at user-level. But having it built-in makes one-line syntax switches possible, so it stays for now.
</p>
<p>
  For now it's called Z, because it's better than C, D, and V. And possibly because I am nostalgic for H1Z1: King of the Kill Pre-season 3.
  Now wish me luck I can settle on an implementation language and not give up on making my dream come true.
  Fortunately, the syntax is so expressive that I could most certainly use it as an integrated shell language and compiled language
  for a simple operating system (still complex just simpler than the bloat that is Windows).
